how to insert an image in markdown?

To insert an image in Markdown, use the following syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text](image-url)
```

- **Alt text**: A descriptive text for the image (for accessibility and when the image fails to load).
- **image-url**: The path or URL to the image.

### Examples

#### Online Image
```markdown
![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/github.png)
```

#### Local Image (Relative Path)
If the image is stored locally in the same folder as your Markdown file:
```markdown
![My Image](image.png)
```

If it's in a subfolder:
```markdown
![My Image](images/image.png)
```

#### Image with Link
To make an image clickable:
```markdown
[![Alt Text](image-url)](link-url)
```

#### Resizing Images
Standard Markdown doesn't support resizing, but you can use HTML for that:
```html
<img src="image-url" width="400">
```

For more details and best practices, see [DigitalOcean's guide on Markdown images](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/markdown-markdown-images) or [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#images).

I want to upload one of the lessons from `./readonly/python`, how do I make the robot pick it up? Should it be referenced from the boot.py?

To make the robot pick up and run a lesson from `./readonly/python`, you generally need to copy the lesson file to the ESP32 and ensure it's executed at boot. Here's how:

### 1. **Copy the Lesson File to ESP32**
You must transfer the desired Python file (e.g., `lesson2.py`) to the ESP32's filesystem. Use tools like **Thonny IDE**, **ampy**, or **WebREPL**:

#### With Thonny IDE:
1. Open Thonny.
2. Go to `View > Files`.
3. Select your ESP32 port.
4. Drag and drop the lesson file (e.g., `lesson2.py`) from your computer to the ESP32 filesystem.

#### With ampy (command line):
```bash
ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 put lesson2.py
```

### 2. **Ensure Execution at Boot**
There are two main boot files:
- `boot.py`: Runs first. Used for initialization (network setup, etc.).
- `main.py`: Runs after `boot.py`. This is where your main program logic goes.

#### Option 1: Rename Your Lesson to `main.py`
The simplest way to run a lesson at boot is to name it `main.py`. For example:
```bash
ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 put lesson2.py main.py
```

✅ This will automatically run `lesson2.py` after `boot.py` finishes.

#### Option 2: Import the Lesson in `main.py`
If you want to keep the original filename:
1. Upload the lesson as `lesson2.py`.
2. Create or edit `main.py` to import and run it:
   ```python
   import lesson2
   ```

⚠️ Make sure `lesson2.py` has a `main()` function or top-level code to execute.

#### Option 3: Conditional Logic in `main.py`
Use `main.py` for dynamic selection:
```python
# main.py
import lesson2  # or lesson3, etc.
```

### Key Notes
- ✅ `boot.py` is for setup only—keep it minimal.
- ✅ `main.py` is typically used for launching your main program.
- ⚠️ Avoid naming conflicts—only one `main.py` can run automatically.
- ❌ Don't overwrite `boot.py` unless required for network or hardware setup.
