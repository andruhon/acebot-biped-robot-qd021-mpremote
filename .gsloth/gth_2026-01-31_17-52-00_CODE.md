I'll help you create a README.md file for the project based on the instructions and explaining how to connect with mpremote and list files. First, let me check the scratchpad.md file to understand the project better.


Requested tools: read_file(path: scratchpad.md)


📁 Reading file: scratchpad.md

Based on the scratchpad.md content and the instructions, I'll create a README.md file that explains how to use mpremote to connect to a MicroPython device and list files. Let me create the README.md file:


Requested tools: write_file(path: README.md, content: # Acebot Biped Controller

This project contain...)


📁 Writing file: README.md

I've created a README.md file for the Acebot Biped project that explains how to use mpremote to connect to a MicroPython device and list files.

The README includes:

1. A brief project description
2. Instructions for installing mpremote
3. How to list available devices using `mpremote connect list`
4. How to connect to a specific device using the device path
5. How to list files on the device filesystem
6. Additional useful mpremote commands

The file explains the workflow demonstrated in your scratchpad.md, showing how to:
- Identify the correct device (like `/dev/ttyUSB0`)
- Connect to it using mpremote
- List the files on the device filesystem

This should provide clear instructions for anyone who needs to interact with the MicroPython device for the biped robot project.
