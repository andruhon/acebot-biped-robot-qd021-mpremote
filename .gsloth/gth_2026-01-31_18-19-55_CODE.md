 I can see both files. The README.md has an **Installation** subsection under the mpremote section that needs to be moved to INSTALLATION.md.

Let me update both files:  
Requested tools: write_file(content: # Acebot Biped Controller

This project contain..., path: /home/parents/Documents/robots/acebot-biped/REA...), write_file(content: # Installation

## mpremote

`mpremote` is a co..., path: /home/parents/Documents/robots/acebot-biped...


📁 Writing file: /home/parents/Documents/robots/acebot-biped/README.md


📁 Writing file: /home/parents/Documents/robots/acebot-biped/INSTALLATION.md

 ✅ **Done!** I've reorganized the documentation:

### Changes made:

**README.md:**
- Removed the `### Installation` subsection under mpremote section
- Added a reference link to `INSTALLATION.md` instead: *"See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for installation instructions."*

**INSTALLATION.md:**
- Added new `## mpremote` section with the installation instructions (pip and pipx methods)
- The mpremote section now appears first in the installation file, followed by Esptool and Prepare lessons sections

The installation-related content has been consolidated into `INSTALLATION.md` while `README.md` focuses on usage documentation with a reference to the installation file.
