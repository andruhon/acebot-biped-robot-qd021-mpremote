To connect `mpremote` to your ESP32 and list files, follow these steps:

1. First, make sure your ESP32 is connected to your computer via USB and is running MicroPython firmware.

2. To list available devices, you can use:
```
mpremote connect list
```

3. To connect to your ESP32 and list files, you can use:
```
mpremote fs ls
```

This will automatically connect to the first available device (assuming it's your ESP32) and list the files on the device's filesystem.

If you have multiple devices connected or want to specify a particular device, you can use the device ID or port:

```
mpremote connect id:<serial_number> fs ls
```

or

```
mpremote connect port:<path_to_port> fs ls
```

The `fs ls` command will list all files on the device. You can also use `mpremote ls` as a shortcut, which is equivalent to `mpremote fs ls`.

If you want to see more details about the files (like size), you can use:
```
mpremote fs ls -l
```

Here's what each part does:
- `mpremote`: Invokes the MicroPython remote control tool
- `fs`: Specifies filesystem commands
- `ls`: Lists files (with optional `-l` flag for detailed listing)

The connection and disconnection are handled automatically by mpremote when you run this command [micropython.org](https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.23.0/reference/mpremote.html).
